The equipment can get quite expensive.  When you start, the program will have equipment that you can use or borrow.  As you continue you will likely want equipment of your own.  There are resources, such as the ${'[Challenged Athletes Foundation](https://www.challengedathletes.org/)'}, that can help mitigate this cost.`
